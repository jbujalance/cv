# CV
My personal curriculum vitae.
Written with LaTeX, based on the [TwentySeconds template](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex).

## Set up
We need a LaTex distribution on the machine. We recommend to install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).
The easiest way to build the PDF from the source is to use the [LaTeX-Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop).
